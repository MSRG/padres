# Sample configuration/properties file for the PADRES broker.

# REQUIRED.  This key specifies the identifier of the broker.  This ID 
# must be unique across all brokers in the same federation, otherwise,
# there will be duplicate message IDs, and erroneous routing will occur.
# Needless to say more, it will result in a catastrophy.
# Note: brokerID can not contain the symbol "-" (dash)
padres.brokerID=BrokerA

# OPTIONAL (default=1099).  This tells the broker which RMI port it 
# should bind its transport handler to receive messages from clients and 
# neighboring brokers.  Note: An RMI registry should already be running 
# at this port before you start the broker, otherwise you will get an
# RMI exception.
padres.port=1099

# OPTIONAL (default="").  You can specify here one or more neighbors for 
# this broker to connect to upon joining the federation.  An address of 
# a broker typically consists of an IP address and an RMI port.  Multiple 
# broker addresses must be separated by a comma, as shown in the example 
# below.  It is OK to leave this field blank, especially when you are 
# starting the first broker that has no available brokers to which to 
# connect.  There is no default value for this parameter.
#padres.remoteBrokers=128.100.241.50:1100,128.100.241.51:1099

# OPTIONAL (default=30).  This limits the maximum number of times that 
# the broker will attempt to connect to a specified neighboring broker in 
# the padres.remoteBrokers field.
padres.remoteBrokers.retry.limit=30

# OPTIONAL (default=10).  If a connection attempt to a specified neighbor
# broker fails, it waits for this amount of time (in seconds) before trying
# again until the retry limit is reached.
padres.remoteBrokers.retry.pauseTime=10

# OPTIONAL (default=RMI).  List all client bindings that you want this broker
# to instantiate upon startup.  Note: if you specify two or more bindings, you
# must separate each of them by a comma such as the example below.
#padres.bindings=RMI,DB
padres.bindings=RMI

# OPTIONAL (default=NewRete) Possible values either NewRete or Jess
# to specify which matching engine to use. Incorrect parameter will result in 
# using the default value
padres.routerfactory=NewRete

# OPTIONAL (default=db.properties). This specify the name of database
# property file with the path relative to PADRES_HOME.
padres.dbpropertyfile=etc/db/db.properties

# OPTIONAL (default=OFF).  Possible values include "OFF", "FIXED", AND "DYNAMIC". 
# Using "FIXED" or "DYNAMIC" turns on cycles.  
padres.cycles=OFF

# OPTIONAL (default=OFF).  Possible values include "OFF", "LAZY", AND "ACTIVE". 
# Using "LAZY" or "ACTIVE" turns on covering for subscription routing.  The
# difference between lazy and active is that lazy covering will not actively 
# unsubscribe previous subscriptions that are now covered, whereas active will.
padres.covering.subscription=OFF

### ---- for future use ---- ###

# OPTIONAL (default=OFF).  Turns on/off periodic heartbeat publication 
# messages used for fault detection.  Turn this to ON only if you want to run
# the fault detection demo. 
padres.heartbeat=ON

# OPTIONAL (default=OFF). Enables/disables tracing of all publications by
# class name from the monitor client interface. Turning this on adds a
# small overhead to the processing of all publications
# padres.traceall=ON

# OPTIONAL (default=OFF). Turns on/off management interface webserver
padres.consoleinterface=ON

# OPTIONAL (default=OFF). Turns on/off management interface webserver
padres.managementinterface=OFF

# OPTIONAL (default=mi.properties). This specify the name of management interface
# property file with the path relative to PADRES_HOME.
padres.mipropertyfile=etc/mi.properties

# OPTIONAL (default=OFF). This turns covering on/off for advertisement routing
# Not supported yet!
padres.covering.advertisement=OFF

# OPTIONAL (default=OFF). Enables/disable broker management via web interface.
padres.management=OFF

# OPTIONAL (default=etc/web/management). This specify the path to management 
# interface web pages relative to PADRES_HOME.
padres.management.dir=etc/web/management
