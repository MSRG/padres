The properties files in this directory are used to start brokers in the
configuration in the diagram shown below. Connections are indicated by the
arrows (i.e. an arrow from B -> A means A started first and when B starts it
connects to A). All connections are established using the port numbers shown
and with a host of "localhost". By default the brokers only start the RMI
binding, and heartbeating is turned off
