PADRES v1.5 Installation
========================

Dependancies:
-------------
 * Linux OS with bash shell
 * Java 1.6
 * Java RMI Registry
 * Java third party libraries (given the minimum versions):
   o log4j-1.2.13.jar: Java logging library
   o pg73jdbc3.jar: PostgresSQL JDBC Driver
   o jung-1.7.6.jar: Java Universal Network/Graph Framework
     + colt.jar: Cern Colt Scientific Library
     + commons-collections-3.2.jar: Apache Jakarta Commons Collections
   o simple-3.1.3.jar 
   o derby.jar: Apache Derby embedded database (version 10.7.1.1)

The above libraries are included in the PADRES distribution. If you would like
to use your own versions of these libraries, simply delete them from the lib
directory. Be sure that your copies of these libaries are in your Java classpath.

Quick installational instructions
---------------------------------

To install PADRES, execute the following commands. Be sure to replace
"$INSTALL_DIR" with the location where you want to install. The binaries and
scripts will be put in the $INSTALL_DIR/padres/ directory.

 > ./install -d $INSTALL_DIR
 > export PADRES_HOME="$INSTALL_DIR/padres"
 > export PATH="$PATH:$PADRES_HOME/bin"

That's it! Now you can walk through some of the sample deployments in the
PADRES User Guide at http://msrg.org/projects/padres/docs/documentation.php


Detailed installational instructions
------------------------------------
 *  Uncompress the package (if you are seeing this file you have
     already passed this step.) 
    o It will create padres directory inside the directory where
      you downloaded the PADRES package. 
 * Run the install.sh script found in the newly created directory
   (where this INSTALL file found) to install PADRES.
   o By default, the script will install PADRES at
     /usr/local/padres/. You have to run the script with the
     administrator privilege.
   o If you want to change the PADRES default installation directory,
     you can run the install script with the -d option as:
         $ ./install.sh [-d <padres_dir>]
   o You can use the install script to install PADRES anywhere in your
     home directory or you can just treat the created padres
     directory itself as the installation directory (without using the
     install script at all.)
 * Set the environment variables:
   o Make sure the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set.
   o Set an enviornment variable PADRES_HOME with the absolute path of
     the installation directory. 
         $ export PADRES_HOME=<installation_directory>
     Change the value of the <installation_directory> accordingly.
   o Add $PADRES_HOME/bin/ to your PATH variable.
         $ export PATH="$PATH:$PADRES_HOME/bin"
   o Include these lines in your ~/.bashrc file to avoid
     setting the variables every time you reboot your system. 
 * Make sure that the required third party Java libraries are
   installed.
   o Generally the third party libraries are installed in
     $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext/.
   o In case you do not have the necessary third party libraries
     installed in your computer, you can download them from the above
     Download section.
     + Download, uncompress, and use the install_lib.sh included in
       the package to install the libraries. It will install the
       downloaded library files in $PADRES_HOME/lib/ directory (the
       install script need the PADRES_HOME set.) If you are using sudo
       to install, launch the install script as follows: 
         $ sudo ./install_lib.sh -d $PADRES_HOME
