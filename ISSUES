PADRES 2.0: Open issues list
----------------------------

The following issues are know. Future PADRES releases may address these issues.

- A Broker ID can not contain " " (space), "_" (underscore) or "-" (hyphen)
  characters.

- Currently, PADRES does not support duplicate attributes, i.e.,  messages can
  not have duplicate attributes, e.g., a > 10,  a < 5 (ranges will be supported
  in a later release).

- To use the Command Line Interface (CLI), only a single broker can be
  instantiated per JVM (multiple brokers can be instantiated in a single JVM,
  but no CLI can be used). 

- To use the Web Management Interface (WBI), only a single broker per machine
  can be operated (multiple brokers can be run per machine, but then no WMI is
  available).

- Log files do not contain broker IDs.

- The behaviour resulting from running two clients with the same ID on the same
  broker is undefined.

- Currently, only a single consumption policy is supported, consume-and-remain
  (CLI allows purging messages).

- BrokerControl, BrokerMonitor, NetworkDiscovery, HearbeatManager can't be used
  as classes.

- Test case testSubPubMatchingWithTwoSubsWithDiffLastHopWithMoreBrokers is
  failing

- The client GUI does not support unadvertise and unsubscribe operations.
